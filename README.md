Use this template to bootstrap the creation of a TypeScript action. :rocket:

This template includes compilation support, tests, a validation workflow,
publishing, and versioning guidance.

If you are new, there's also a simpler introduction in the
[Hello world JavaScript action repository](https://github.com/actions/hello-world-javascript-action).

## Setup

After you've cloned the repository to your local machine or codespace, you'll
need to perform some initial setup steps before you can develop your action.

> [!NOTE]
>
> You'll need to have a reasonably modern version of
> [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) handy (20.x or later should work!). If you are
> using a version manager like [`nodenv`](https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv) or
> [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), this template has a `.node-version`
> file at the root of the repository that will be used to automatically switch
> to the correct version when you `cd` into the repository. Additionally, this
> `.node-version` file is used by GitHub Actions in any `actions/setup-node`
> actions.

1. :hammer_and_wrench: Install the dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

1. :building_construction: Package the TypeScript for distribution

   ```bash
   npm run bundle
   ```

1. :white_check_mark: Run the tests

   ```bash
   $ npm test

   PASS  ./index.test.js
     ✓ throws invalid number (3ms)
     ✓ wait 500 ms (504ms)
     ✓ test runs (95ms)

   ...
   ```

## Update the Action Metadata

The [`action.yml`](action.yml) file defines metadata about your action, such as
input(s) and output(s). For details about this file, see
[Metadata syntax for GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/metadata-syntax-for-github-actions).

When you copy this repository, update `action.yml` with the name, description,
inputs, and outputs for your action.

1. Create a pull request and get feedback on your action
1. Merge the pull request into the `main` branch

Your action is now published! :rocket:

For information about versioning your action, see
[Versioning](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/action-versioning.md)
in the GitHub Actions toolkit.

## Validate the Action

You can now validate the action by referencing it in a workflow file. For
example, [`ci.yml`](./.github/workflows/ci.yml) demonstrates how to reference an
action in the same repository.

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Checkout
    id: checkout
    uses: actions/checkout@v4

  - name: Test Local Action
    id: test-action
    uses: ./
    with:
      milliseconds: 1000

  - name: Print Output
    id: output
    run: echo "${{ steps.test-action.outputs.time }}"
```

For example workflow runs, check out the
[Actions tab](https://github.com/actions/typescript-action/actions)! :rocket:
